Intro

This chatbox is an exploratory project using a jQueryish frontend and a node.js backend.  I currently host the live copy on Joyent at [dpritchett.no.de](http://dpritchett.no.de).

I have aspirations of making a simple chatbox-based MUD with NPCs that use the same API clients use to read and write to the chat stream.
